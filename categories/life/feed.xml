&lt;p>I used to get &lt;em>immense&lt;/em> value out of Twitter. Often times, I hear other developers say &amp;lsquo;Twitter was always shit&amp;rsquo; or something similar - but I vehemently disagree.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-gap-twitter---xitter-left-in-my-life">The gap Twitter -&amp;gt; Xitter left in my life&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The gamedev community and tech twitter used to be &lt;em>fucking fantastic&lt;/em>, if you curated who you followed on your account (a hard requirement!) your feed would be full of genuinely interesting tidbits of information - things you could only learn from other gamedevs or people making software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the stench/musk wore off, I observed as all of the interesting tech and gamedev people I knew either left X/Twitter to go to (anecdotally):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Discord (60% of people)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mastodon (10% of people - I saw many &lt;em>proclaim&lt;/em> they would do this, but in practice I find many are not active here)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No where - they just left Twitter and stopped sharing short-but-insightful content entirely. When they have more well-formed thoughts, there are blog posts or whatever - but most interesting thoughts don&amp;rsquo;t reach that stage and are simply lost to the wind unless you are in direct communication with them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="discord-ate-twitters-lunch">Discord ate Twitter&amp;rsquo;s lunch&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>And that brings me to my point: most of my interesting tech/gamedev interactions are over Discord today, in private servers or DMs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have fantastic interesting technical conversations with other software engineers in Discord that you&amp;rsquo;d probably love to be part of - you can&amp;rsquo;t, because Discord is silo&amp;rsquo;d off so fuck you (I imagine the Discord company saying) - but the point remains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, I just don&amp;rsquo;t get any value out of Twitter / X. For sharing my own work/interests, the people I&amp;rsquo;d like to share it with aren&amp;rsquo;t really on the platform either.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="quality-and-shit-takes">Quality and shit takes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It used to be the case that my Twitter feed was 80-90% interesting, quality content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today it&amp;rsquo;s more like 10%, with the remainder being made up of lukewarm advertisements, the latest hot-dump thread from some tech bro claiming how to build a multi-million dollar business using AI, or fellow American&amp;rsquo;s looking for opportunities to justify support of a traitor. I want nothing to do with it. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be associated with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The highlight&lt;/em> of my Twitter experience is professional Japanese programmers posting seemingly blissfully unaware inspirational quotes and cat photos, and for them I want to say a special thanks for brightening my days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As a final act, I make the account sit empty with a single post suggesting to donate to &lt;a href="https://www.aspca.org/ways-to-give">animal well-fare&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>War with small language models</title><link>https://slimsag.com/2024/war-with-small-language-models/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slimsag.com/2024/war-with-small-language-models/</guid><description>&lt;p>Everyone knows how error-prone, blissfully naive, and illogical &lt;em>large&lt;/em> language models can be a times. And so I have a bit of a self-deprecating joke wherein I say I used a small language model to create something - to write some code, to create a document, etc. i.e. my brain is only slightly more intelligent than a bag of bricks. I both believe this &lt;em>and&lt;/em> am okay with this. :)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="war-with-small-language-models">War with small language models&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I think what&amp;rsquo;s fascinating is how I can look around myself and see accomplishments of my past self; whether it be the career I&amp;rsquo;ve had, the family I&amp;rsquo;ve rescued, the garden I&amp;rsquo;ve cared for year-over-year, or code I&amp;rsquo;ve written in past years that others seem to appreciate more than I do today (a uniquely fascinating feeling in itself.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being able to introspect on past accomplishments - and more importantly reflect on my state of mind during the time I was making those achievements - tells me that I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved great things through two primary means:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Most often through sheer luck or encountering uniquely impactful individuals through environments I put myself in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By going to war with my small language model, i.e. brain.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In its default state, my small language model would love to sit around, watch mind-numbing YouTube videos, procrastinate, embrace seemingly bi-polar thoughts of anxiety or fear for the future, enjoy the latest hype train or controversial discussion that the tech scene has to offer, neglect chores, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A naive onlooker might be able to observe such a small language model and identify its behavior patterns, where it gets positive and negative feelings, how the context and environment of the day plays into its outputs, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A more intelligent onlooker, however, might be able to observe that although the small language model is.. well, rather naive and frankly stupid - that its training data has something fundamentally strange in it. The daily desires and short-lived ups and downs, which appear frankly erratic, barely influence the long-term desire to so something &lt;em>ultimately great - an achievement like no other&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A drive and almost hard-coded sentiment that underpins everything, enforcing that what the small language model does day to day virtually doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, because there &lt;em>must&lt;/em> exist a singular spectacular achievement within the lifetime or else there was no lifetime to begin with. A theory that the small language model &lt;em>would have no reason to have been created&lt;/em> if it were not for a great achievement towards the end of its function - and so therefor there &lt;em>must exist&lt;/em> a great achievement somewhere in its execution despite any localized challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is only with that sentiment and undertone, that war can exist - that the daily annoyances of the small language models&amp;rsquo; limited context, seemingly swaying daily thoughts of positivity and negativity, can all blur away to instead build towards the the drive and passion for a long-term great achievement - an environment where frankly nothing else matters - neatly encapsulated in that small language model.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thats-all-for-now-folks">That&amp;rsquo;s all for now, folks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The above is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to find a way to articulate / express for a while, I hope you enjoyed it or find it useful for your own path in life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The most ridiculous cat photos ever</title><link>https://slimsag.com/2024/meowarmy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slimsag.com/2024/meowarmy/</guid><description>&lt;p>This post is literally just to tell you I put ridiculous cat photos at &lt;a href="https://meow.army">https://meow.army&lt;/a> - enjoy.&lt;/p>
