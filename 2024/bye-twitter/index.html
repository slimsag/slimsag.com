â€¢ <a class=category href=/categories/life>life</a></div></header><p>Today I deleted my Twitter account.</p><p>I used to get <em>immense</em> value out of Twitter. Often times, I hear other developers say &lsquo;Twitter was always shit&rsquo; or something similar - but I vehemently disagree.</p><h2 id=the-gap-twitter---xitter-left-in-my-life>The gap Twitter -> Xitter left in my life</h2><p>The gamedev community and tech twitter used to be <em>fucking fantastic</em>, if you curated who you followed on your account (a hard requirement!) your feed would be full of genuinely interesting tidbits of information - things you could only learn from other gamedevs or people making software.</p><p>After the stench/musk wore off, I observed as all of the interesting tech and gamedev people I knew either left X/Twitter to go to (anecdotally):</p><ul><li>Discord (60% of people)</li><li>Mastodon (10% of people - I saw many <em>proclaim</em> they would do this, but in practice I find many are not active here)</li><li>No where - they just left Twitter and stopped sharing short-but-insightful content entirely. When they have more well-formed thoughts, there are blog posts or whatever - but most interesting thoughts don&rsquo;t reach that stage and are simply lost to the wind unless you are in direct communication with them.</li></ul><h2 id=discord-ate-twitters-lunch>Discord ate Twitter&rsquo;s lunch</h2><p>And that brings me to my point: most of my interesting tech/gamedev interactions are over Discord today, in private servers or DMs.</p><p>I have fantastic interesting technical conversations with other software engineers in Discord that you&rsquo;d probably love to be part of - you can&rsquo;t, because Discord is silo&rsquo;d off so fuck you (I imagine the Discord company saying) - but the point remains.</p><p>Today, I just don&rsquo;t get any value out of Twitter / X. For sharing my own work/interests, the people I&rsquo;d like to share it with aren&rsquo;t really on the platform either.</p><h2 id=quality-and-shit-takes>Quality and shit takes</h2><p>It used to be the case that my Twitter feed was 80-90% interesting, quality content.</p><p>Today it&rsquo;s more like 10%, with the remainder being made up of lukewarm advertisements, the latest hot-dump thread from some tech bro claiming how to build a multi-million dollar business using AI, or fellow American&rsquo;s looking for opportunities to justify support of a traitor. I want nothing to do with it. I don&rsquo;t want to be associated with it.</p><p><em>The highlight</em> of my Twitter experience is professional Japanese programmers posting seemingly blissfully unaware inspirational quotes and cat photos, and for them I want to say a special thanks for brightening my days.</p><p><img src=/img/2024/twitter.jpg alt></p><h2 id=bye-twitter>Bye Twitter</h2><p>As a final act, I make the account sit empty with a single post suggesting to donate to <a href=https://www.aspca.org/ways-to-give>animal well-fare</a>.</p></div></main><script>function addAnchor(e){e.insertAdjacentHTML("afterbegin",`<a href="#${e.id}" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> `)}document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){var e=document.querySelectorAll("h1[id], h2[id], h3[id], h4[id]");e&&e.forEach(addAnchor)})</script></div><div class=footer><div class=row-1><span>Thanks for reading my blog.
