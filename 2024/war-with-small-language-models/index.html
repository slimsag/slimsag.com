â€¢ <a class=category href=/categories/life>life</a></div></header><p>Everyone knows how error-prone, blissfully naive, and illogical <em>large</em> language models can be a times. And so I have a bit of a self-deprecating joke wherein I say I used a small language model to create something - to write some code, to create a document, etc. i.e. my brain is only slightly more intelligent than a bag of bricks. I both believe this <em>and</em> am okay with this. :)</p><h2 id=war-with-small-language-models>War with small language models</h2><p>I think what&rsquo;s fascinating is how I can look around myself and see accomplishments of my past self; whether it be the career I&rsquo;ve had, the family I&rsquo;ve rescued, the garden I&rsquo;ve cared for year-over-year, or code I&rsquo;ve written in past years that others seem to appreciate more than I do today (a uniquely fascinating feeling in itself.)</p><p>Being able to introspect on past accomplishments - and more importantly reflect on my state of mind during the time I was making those achievements - tells me that I&rsquo;ve achieved great things through two primary means:</p><ol><li>Most often through sheer luck or encountering uniquely impactful individuals through environments I put myself in.</li><li>By going to war with my small language model, i.e. brain.</li></ol><p>In its default state, my small language model would love to sit around, watch mind-numbing YouTube videos, procrastinate, embrace seemingly bi-polar thoughts of anxiety or fear for the future, enjoy the latest hype train or controversial discussion that the tech scene has to offer, neglect chores, etc.</p><p>A naive onlooker might be able to observe such a small language model and identify its behavior patterns, where it gets positive and negative feelings, how the context and environment of the day plays into its outputs, etc.</p><p>A more intelligent onlooker, however, might be able to observe that although the small language model is.. well, rather naive and frankly stupid - that its training data has something fundamentally strange in it. The daily desires and short-lived ups and downs, which appear frankly erratic, barely influence the long-term desire to so something <em>ultimately great - an achievement like no other</em>.</p><p>A drive and almost hard-coded sentiment that underpins everything, enforcing that what the small language model does day to day virtually doesn&rsquo;t matter, because there <em>must</em> exist a singular spectacular achievement within the lifetime or else there was no lifetime to begin with. A theory that the small language model <em>would have no reason to have been created</em> if it were not for a great achievement towards the end of its function - and so therefor there <em>must exist</em> a great achievement somewhere in its execution despite any localized challenges.</p><p>It is only with that sentiment and undertone, that war can exist - that the daily annoyances of the small language models&rsquo; limited context, seemingly swaying daily thoughts of positivity and negativity, can all blur away to instead build towards the the drive and passion for a long-term great achievement - an environment where frankly nothing else matters - neatly encapsulated in that small language model.</p><h2 id=thats-all-for-now-folks>That&rsquo;s all for now, folks</h2><p>The above is something I&rsquo;ve been trying to find a way to articulate / express for a while, I hope you enjoyed it or find it useful for your own path in life.</p></div></main><script>function addAnchor(e){e.insertAdjacentHTML("afterbegin",`<a href="#${e.id}" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> `)}document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){var e=document.querySelectorAll("h1[id], h2[id], h3[id], h4[id]");e&&e.forEach(addAnchor)})</script></div><div class=footer><div class=row-1><span>Thanks for reading my ðŸ’© thoughts feed.
