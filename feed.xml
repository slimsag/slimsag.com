&lt;p>&lt;em>[Bitch, Don&amp;rsquo;t Kill My Vibe]&lt;/em> because I have no vested interest here; I don&amp;rsquo;t use Elastic Search, it&amp;rsquo;s not really my cup of tea - the product doesn&amp;rsquo;t appeal to me - so I don&amp;rsquo;t really care what happens to it as software. I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in the corporate double-speak in what they wrote, and their motivations for proclaiming to be &amp;lsquo;open source&amp;rsquo; again.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Open source is in my DNA. It is in Elastic DNA. Being able to call Elasticsearch Open Source again is pure joy.
&amp;hellip;
But being able to use the term Open Source, by using AGPL, an OSI approved license, removes any questions, or fud, people might have.
&amp;hellip;
We never stopped believing in Open Source at Elastic&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Money Trees]&lt;/em> don&amp;rsquo;t grow in just any environment, they grow when you give out free apples, wait for people to bite, and once their stomach is full tell them it was poisoned and offer an antidote for a price. It&amp;rsquo;s got to be painful that AWS&amp;rsquo; OpenSearch &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/opensearch/">product page&lt;/a> paints their fork in such a shining light, proclaiming to be the saviors of open source because big-bad Elastic had to go and make their license proprietary. It &lt;em>must&lt;/em> feel joyful in such a circumstance to have found a potential outlet.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>3 years later, Amazon is fully invested in their fork, the market confusion has been (mostly) resolved, and our partnership with AWS is stronger than ever. We were even named AWS partner of the year. I had always hoped that enough time would pass that we could feel safe to get back to being an Open Source project - and it finally has.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Hood Politics]&lt;/em> sometimes means making friends with your enemies. For example, sometimes you lose the battle, and your enemy has a stronghold over the market where your product (no, not drugs, but your software) can be sold. Is it the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-voru33wi6xs7k?sr=0-1&amp;amp;ref_=beagle&amp;amp;applicationId=AWSMPContessa">AWS Marketplace private offers of Elastic Cloud&lt;/a>? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but I do know that many companies allocate budget to AWS - and requesting new budgets is &lt;em>tough&lt;/em> - so sometimes if you can buy &lt;em>other things&lt;/em> using your pre-allocated AWS budget &amp;hellip; it makes things simpler. I guess if you do well enough, you could even become partner of the year. The big guy in the room doesn&amp;rsquo;t care, he gets his cut both ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>we are simply adding another option [AGPL], and not removing anything&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Vanity Slaves]&lt;/em> Adding another option &lt;em>does&lt;/em> mean you can &lt;em>factually&lt;/em> proclaim to be open-source according to the OSI definition. You got all the checkboxes checked, you did it right, you are open source, I agree. But we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want any enterprise customers misreading &amp;lsquo;we&amp;rsquo;re now open source&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;we maybe don&amp;rsquo;t need to renew our enterprise license&amp;rsquo; or thinking &amp;lsquo;we can&amp;rsquo;t use AGPL!&amp;rsquo;, would we? Good call adding this clarification that &lt;em>the other licenses&lt;/em> are also available.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We chose AGPL, vs another license [..] Heck, maybe AGPL is enough for infrastructure software like us with how things have progressed since we had to change the license (for example, Grafana who moved to it from Apache2). We are committed to figure it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Still Hustlin]&lt;/em> is how I imagine the Google Docs comments reviewing this public statement looked: &amp;rsquo;the key point to drive home with this paragraph is we want Elastic to be considered Open Source, we want the developer sentiment boost which comes with that, we &lt;em>want&lt;/em> to be able to tell people we&amp;rsquo;re giving away our amazing software because we&amp;rsquo;re amazing. [but we also need to get paid]&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>With any change, there can be confusion, and, of course, there can be trolls. (Aren’t there always trolls?)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Bitch I&amp;rsquo;m in the Club]&lt;/em> that&amp;rsquo;s me I guess! sorry?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“AGPL is not true open source, license X is”: AGPL is an OSI approved license, and it&amp;rsquo;s a widely adopted one. [&amp;hellip;] MongoDB [&amp;hellip;] Grafana [&amp;hellip;] AGPL doesn’t affect usage or &lt;strong>popularity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Hol&amp;rsquo; Up]&lt;/em> is that &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41276315">&lt;em>literally&lt;/em> me&lt;/a>? fuck! In that case, I&amp;rsquo;ll get a bit serious: I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is anything wrong with Elastic, Mongo, Grafana, or whatever using AGPL. By all means, it&amp;rsquo;s your software, your license, do as you please. But I think the spirit of the article titled &amp;lsquo;Elasticsearch is open source, again&amp;rsquo; is to convey that things have returned to &lt;em>how they once were&lt;/em>. &lt;strong>But wait, wasn&amp;rsquo;t Elastic Apache licensed before?&lt;/strong> - why the change to AGPL then?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[You Ain&amp;rsquo;t Gotta Lie (Momma Said)]&lt;/em> the truth is that there are two types of people looking for &amp;lsquo;open source&amp;rsquo;: you&amp;rsquo;ve got the OSI who defines Open Source and says AGPL is Open Source (and, Elastic, again, you&amp;rsquo;ve got those checkboxes checked - congrats you are open source!) But, if I had to speculate, one of the values of Elastic being &amp;lsquo;open source&amp;rsquo; before was that someone could go to their boss and say &amp;lsquo;yo, this tool is great, let&amp;rsquo;s use it&amp;rsquo; and not need to procure a license for it from you? Like &amp;lsquo;use it my preferred way&amp;rsquo; style. Unfortunately, with AGPL (almost certainly as your lawyers advised you) &lt;a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-10-agpl-license-is-a-non-starter-for-most-companies/">is a non-starter for most companies&lt;/a> and is outright banned by most legal departments for use within companies. The answer to that employee would most certainly be &amp;lsquo;we cannot use that software unless we contact our procurement team to get a license from their sales team&amp;rsquo; - but I&amp;rsquo;m sure you know that, because that is indeed basically &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41396278">the business strategy of companies like Grafana and other infrastructure companies that you refer to&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Elastic changes the license because they are not doing well” - I will start by saying that I am as excited today as ever about the future of Elastic. I am tremendously proud of our products and our team&amp;rsquo;s execution. We shipped Stateless Elasticsearch, ES|QL, and tons of vector database/hybrid search improvements for GenAI use cases. We are leaning heavily into OTel in logging and Observability. And our SIEM product in Security keeps adding amazing features and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the fastest growing in the market. Users&amp;rsquo; response has been humbling. The stock market will have its ups and downs. What I can assure you, is that we are always thinking long term, and this change is part of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[These Walls]&lt;/em> are closing in, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41397398">that graph&lt;/a> showing how OpenSearch is closing in and eating all your new installs. That&amp;rsquo;s fucking scary, I don&amp;rsquo;t envy you - I have sympathy - best of luck to you adding the differentiation features to make your product uniquely valuable again. I do think that&amp;rsquo;s the right move for yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://slimsag.com/img/2024/elastic.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[United in Grief] I think it&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate and regrettable how conflated the term &amp;lsquo;open source&amp;rsquo; has become. Is Elastic not being &amp;lsquo;OSI-approved open source&amp;rsquo; a good reason for people to switch to OpenSearch? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. Is it wrong that Amazon can take some code you gave away for free, under permissive terms in hopes of gaining popularity, and sell it to their customers? I also don&amp;rsquo;t think so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[I Am] just a bit frustrated by the double-speak, I understand why you have to do it, I just wish you didn&amp;rsquo;t have to. I wish you could be honest about what the license actually is (&amp;lsquo;you can see our code and contribute to it, but to use it in a company you must purchase a license&amp;rsquo;) or just declare it closed-source like some other companies I&amp;rsquo;ve seen (&lt;em>cough&lt;/em>) rather than having to hide behind lucrative knowledge of how enterise customers&amp;rsquo; legal teams will scoff at the idea of Elastic being AGPL software.. just so that they can tell your users to go talk to their procurement team if they need it so you can get sales. That&amp;rsquo;s so many weirdly convoluted layers to go through (oh god, did I say convoluted layers?) and when I read seemingly hidden agendas, veiled proclaimations of being &amp;rsquo;the good guys&amp;rsquo;, and quirky-fun ways of writing public statements with Kendrick Lamar songs as openings - I sometimes feel like &lt;em>I am the one&lt;/em> who should be [Institutionalized]. Blegh!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[YAH.] that&amp;rsquo;s all. No harm or malice to ya&amp;rsquo;ll intended, just some genuine criticism of our world and your role in it. Also this is my 💩 thoughts feed, I am a clown and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be taken seriously.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bye Twitter</title><link>https://slimsag.com/2024/bye-twitter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slimsag.com/2024/bye-twitter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I deleted my Twitter account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used to get &lt;em>immense&lt;/em> value out of Twitter. Often times, I hear other developers say &amp;lsquo;Twitter was always shit&amp;rsquo; or something similar - but I vehemently disagree.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-gap-twitter---xitter-left-in-my-life">The gap Twitter -&amp;gt; Xitter left in my life&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The gamedev community and tech twitter used to be &lt;em>fucking fantastic&lt;/em>, if you curated who you followed on your account (a hard requirement!) your feed would be full of genuinely interesting tidbits of information - things you could only learn from other gamedevs or people making software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the stench/musk wore off, I observed as all of the interesting tech and gamedev people I knew either left X/Twitter to go to (anecdotally):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Discord (60% of people)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mastodon (10% of people - I saw many &lt;em>proclaim&lt;/em> they would do this, but in practice I find many are not active here)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No where - they just left Twitter and stopped sharing short-but-insightful content entirely. When they have more well-formed thoughts, there are blog posts or whatever - but most interesting thoughts don&amp;rsquo;t reach that stage and are simply lost to the wind unless you are in direct communication with them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="discord-ate-twitters-lunch">Discord ate Twitter&amp;rsquo;s lunch&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>And that brings me to my point: most of my interesting tech/gamedev interactions are over Discord today, in private servers or DMs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have fantastic interesting technical conversations with other software engineers in Discord that you&amp;rsquo;d probably love to be part of - you can&amp;rsquo;t, because Discord is silo&amp;rsquo;d off so fuck you (I imagine the Discord company saying) - but the point remains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, I just don&amp;rsquo;t get any value out of Twitter / X. For sharing my own work/interests, the people I&amp;rsquo;d like to share it with aren&amp;rsquo;t really on the platform either.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="quality-and-shit-takes">Quality and shit takes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It used to be the case that my Twitter feed was 80-90% interesting, quality content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today it&amp;rsquo;s more like 10%, with the remainder being made up of lukewarm advertisements, the latest hot-dump thread from some tech bro claiming how to build a multi-million dollar business using AI, or fellow American&amp;rsquo;s looking for opportunities to justify support of a traitor. I want nothing to do with it. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be associated with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The highlight&lt;/em> of my Twitter experience is professional Japanese programmers posting seemingly blissfully unaware inspirational quotes and cat photos, and for them I want to say a special thanks for brightening my days.&lt;/p>

And so I have a bit of a self-deprecating joke wherein I say I used a small language model to create something - to write some code, to create a document, etc. i.e. my brain is only slightly more intelligent than a bag of bricks. I both believe this &lt;em>and&lt;/em> am okay with this. :)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="war-with-small-language-models">War with small language models&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I think what&amp;rsquo;s fascinating is how I can look around myself and see accomplishments of my past self; whether it be the career I&amp;rsquo;ve had, the family I&amp;rsquo;ve rescued, the garden I&amp;rsquo;ve cared for year-over-year, or code I&amp;rsquo;ve written in past years that others seem to appreciate more than I do today (a uniquely fascinating feeling in itself.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being able to introspect on past accomplishments - and more importantly reflect on my state of mind during the time I was making those achievements - tells me that I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved great things through two primary means:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Most often through sheer luck or encountering uniquely impactful individuals through environments I put myself in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By going to war with my small language model, i.e. brain.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In its default state, my small language model would love to sit around, watch mind-numbing YouTube videos, procrastinate, embrace seemingly bi-polar thoughts of anxiety or fear for the future, enjoy the latest hype train or controversial discussion that the tech scene has to offer, neglect chores, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A naive onlooker might be able to observe such a small language model and identify its behavior patterns, where it gets positive and negative feelings, how the context and environment of the day plays into its outputs, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A more intelligent onlooker, however, might be able to observe that although the small language model is.. well, rather naive and frankly stupid - that its training data has something fundamentally strange in it. The daily desires and short-lived ups and downs, which appear frankly erratic, barely influence the long-term desire to so something &lt;em>ultimately great - an achievement like no other&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A drive and almost hard-coded sentiment that underpins everything, enforcing that what the small language model does day to day virtually doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, because there &lt;em>must&lt;/em> exist a singular spectacular achievement within the lifetime or else there was no lifetime to begin with. A theory that the small language model &lt;em>would have no reason to have been created&lt;/em> if it were not for a great achievement towards the end of its function - and so therefor there &lt;em>must exist&lt;/em> a great achievement somewhere in its execution despite any localized challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is only with that sentiment and undertone, that war can exist - that the daily annoyances of the small language models&amp;rsquo; limited context, seemingly swaying daily thoughts of positivity and negativity, can all blur away to instead build towards the the drive and passion for a long-term great achievement - an environment where frankly nothing else matters - neatly encapsulated in that small language model.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thats-all-for-now-folks">That&amp;rsquo;s all for now, folks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The above is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to find a way to articulate / express for a while, I hope you enjoyed it or find it useful for your own path in life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RFC8667: Sillycon Valley</title><link>https://slimsag.com/2024/rfc8667-sillycon-valley/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slimsag.com/2024/rfc8667-sillycon-valley/</guid><description>&lt;p>Proposed variant of / inspired fanatically by &lt;a href="https://www.secrethitler.com">another popular tabletop game&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://slimsag.com/img/2024/f5bot.jpg">&lt;img src="https://slimsag.com/img/2024/f5bot.jpg" alt="">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time, I tend ot advertise my &lt;a href="https://github.com/sponsors/slimsag">GitHub sponsors page&lt;/a> somewhat regularly. I try not to be overbearing about it, but also just let people know: you can sponsor my FOSS work if you want to.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="then-the-spam-began">Then the spam began&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Some lady adopted a variation of my username &lt;code>slimsag&lt;/code> as her own Reddit username, which caused f5bot to pick up on it (it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do whole-word matches, but rather substring) - my inbox was getting notifications every day about this lady advertising her OF profile:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At first I was a bit put-off by these notifications: I don&amp;rsquo;t want this crap in my inbox every morning. But over time, I came to realize how much she is advertising &lt;em>her work and soliciting donations&lt;/em>.. and I am not.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s time for FOSS developers to stop living in the shadows! For too long people have been afraid to share that they too write nasty FOSS code on the side for strangers&amp;rsquo; pleasure on the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another popular website&amp;rsquo;s creators make $4.46 billion USD per year, but how much do FOSS developers make per year?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>onlybits.org aims to get FOSS developers a fraction of that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Registration is simple - you&amp;rsquo;re already registered. &lt;code>https://onlybits.org/username&lt;/code> redirects to &lt;code>https://github.com/username&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example: you can view some hot, steamy bits at &lt;a href="https://onlybits.org/hexops/mach">onlybits.org/hexops/mach&lt;/a> - but don&amp;rsquo;t forget to tip at &lt;a href="https://onlybits.org/sponsors/slimsag">onlybits.org/sponsors/slimsag&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To advertise, you can also use the &lt;code>OB&lt;/code> logo and emojis - like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://slimsag.com/img/2024/onlybits.png">&lt;img src="https://slimsag.com/img/2024/onlybits.png" alt="">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
