&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this and are a stranger, friend, coworker, peer - or someone in my close social circle - my mom or dad, my siblings, etc. then this will either come as a great surprise to you or something you&amp;rsquo;ve suspected but a conversation you never wanted to approach. All I ask of you is that you keep an open mind when interpreting my experience. I&amp;rsquo;m not writing about a political position, I am writing about &lt;em>me&lt;/em> - the best part of me, the part of me which I love most and &lt;em>cannot change&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-this-affects-you-tldr-for-friends-family-and-coworkers">How this affects you (TL;DR for friends, family, and coworkers)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here are the questions I believe you will have.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="so-you-believe-you-are-a-woman-you-identify-as-transgender">&amp;lsquo;So, you believe you are a woman? You identify as transgender?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Yes. I want you to know I fundamentally core to my soul believe I am a woman.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve lived with that for 15 years, and this writing is the first time I have ever told anyone other than a sexual partner.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-should-i-do">&amp;lsquo;What should I do?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you wish to continue being a part of my life, you can write me something short like &amp;lsquo;Hey stephen, saw your post but didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to read the whole thing, just know I support you&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>If I do not hear from you in the coming weeks, I will have no choice but to assume you wish to terminate communication with me as a result of disclosing who I am - which I am absolutely fine with.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-do-i-call-you">&amp;lsquo;What do I call you?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Stephen is fine. He/him is fine. They/them is nicer, but I don&amp;rsquo;t mind whatever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am optimizing for &lt;em>your comfort&lt;/em> because I like to be a pleasing person&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re curious what I call myself it is &amp;lsquo;Emi, she/her&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="i-understand-but-feel-uncomfortable-about-how-to-approach-you-now-is-that-okay">&amp;lsquo;I understand, but feel uncomfortable about how to approach you now, is that okay?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Yes. I&amp;rsquo;m open to talk, answer questions bluntly and honestly. I suggest only asking questions you are sure you want the answer to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For friends and family, I am happy to answer questions that you may feel are intrusive, hateful, rude, etc. - I mean this genuinely, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to preface your questions with timidness. I&amp;rsquo;m an open book and will do my best to give you clarity into how my mind thinks here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The uncomfort you are feeling right now about me saying I am a woman - I have lived with that &lt;em>confusion&lt;/em>, &lt;em>discomfort&lt;/em>, and at times &lt;em>fear&lt;/em> and &lt;em>anxiety&lt;/em> for the last 15 years of my life. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry you&amp;rsquo;re going through that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="will-you-appear-differently-when-i-see-you-in-person">&amp;lsquo;Will you appear differently when I see you in person?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Various people have noticed in the past few years changes to my appearance, including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Piercings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Changes to my weight, chest, or face (I am happy with how I look today)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Neon hair colors or long/wild hair styles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wearing my more feminine prescription glasses by accident in Zoom calls&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All of these factors of my appearance I have in general tried to hide from you in one form or another - whether through jokes / brushing it off, or by altering my appearance before I see you face to face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those aspects I will no longer try to hide from you, because it&amp;rsquo;s frankly fucking annoying to do so. That said, I care about the comfort of people around me and understand that, for example, dressing in a skirt could make you uncomfortable. I have no plans to change how I dress in public, for the comfort of others and safety of myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="are-you-seeking-treatment-drugs-surgeries">&amp;lsquo;Are you seeking treatment? Drugs? Surgeries?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I am not interested in speaking publicly about specifics, but the general answer is that I am generally happy with how I am today and have been for the last few years of my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should understand that I am not infected by some brain-eating worm like RFK Jr: I consider treatment, drugs, and surgeries just as seriously as you do for your own body and do not take them lightly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="have-you-ever-shared-this-with-anyone">&amp;lsquo;Have you ever shared this with anyone?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Besides a few sexual partners, no.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the first time anyone is publicly hearing this from me, and the first time my closest friends, family, relatives and peers will be hearing anything about it as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="will-you-date-girls-guys-lgbt-people">&amp;lsquo;Will you date girls? guys? LGBT people?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>No major announcement here; I like girls, always have. I am not dating anyone currently.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-now">&amp;lsquo;Why now?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Growing up in rural Arizona in the 2000s and 2010s, I remember hearing on the radio (yes, the radio) the talking heads debating whether or not gay people should be allowed to get married. I remember it was a massive conversation among adults at the time, and politicians were saying it was the devil, the rise of satanism, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were other experiences as a child that I will spare details on here so as to not cause concern for family/friends. Just know that I&amp;rsquo;m okay, and if you&amp;rsquo;re a parent reading this - I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like you failed me in any way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a teenager, dating people my own age was confusing and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make sense of the dynamic at play because &lt;em>I wanted to be the woman in the relationship&lt;/em> and &lt;em>the women I was dating wanted that too&lt;/em> - which led to general confusion and ultimately the failure of all of my relationships. At this time, I did not have any notion or understanding of transgenderism, or most things in LGBTQ. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I was into adulthood ~9 years ago that I began to understand &lt;em>why&lt;/em> I was different, &lt;em>how&lt;/em> I was different, and &lt;em>why&lt;/em> I was struggling with relationships both romantically and with my normal peer groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In adulthood, I took a remote job which gave me the ability to spend a good portion of my time alone and by myself isolated away from society. This gave me the opportunity to understand and explore who I was and express myself as &lt;em>just me&lt;/em> at home - without feeling like I was imposing myself on anybody, because I am naturally a pretty comforming-to-society person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve had various encounters with people from all different walks of life - in programming communities or elsewhere that:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a. Threw me heavily me off my footing and made me feel like someone &amp;lsquo;saw who I was&amp;rsquo; in both intimate and friend-group situations.
b. Allowed me to see other people living life with different choices than me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was around this time maybe 4-5 years ago that I knew I &lt;em>could&lt;/em> live publicly if I wanted to, but seeing some of the immense hardship faced by some of these individuals - both with normal friend-group interactions and in professional settings, I was not sure that I would be capable of facing this, wondering every day:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Whether people would hide their true thoughts/opinions around me (&amp;rsquo;the libs&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;I identify as an apache helicopter&amp;rsquo;, etc.) or not because they feel I am too sensitive to hear what they have to say? Or because I&amp;rsquo;m not part of &amp;rsquo;the boys club&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whether that promotion I missed is genuinely because I didn&amp;rsquo;t perform enough on merit, or because of people&amp;rsquo;s biased perceptions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whether that opportunity I got was on my own hard work and merit, or someone else&amp;rsquo;s perception of what is right or wrong?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wondering if people sitting at a table are taking what I am saying seriously, or thinking something else and just nodding along?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In short, &lt;strong>I was afraid to be public about who I am because I was afraid of how those around me would react.&lt;/strong> I thought that living the remainder of my life in private would really not be so bad, and until today that was my intention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the historic election results of 2024, I am no longer afraid of those around me. Rather, I am afraid of my entire country. I am afraid that approximately half of my country, in one form or another, feels I am less than human - deserving less of an ability to treat my physical and mental health - and believes my right to live as a person free from government overreach, persecution, and violence - is not important.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, I felt forced today to be public about who I am - to let people know we are out there, hiding in the shadows among you, terrified of the reckless decisions you make that affect the remainder of my short life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Respectfully, fuck you and peace motherfuckers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>[Bitch, Don&amp;rsquo;t Kill My Vibe]&lt;/em> because I have no vested interest here; I don&amp;rsquo;t use Elastic Search, it&amp;rsquo;s not really my cup of tea - the product doesn&amp;rsquo;t appeal to me - so I don&amp;rsquo;t really care what happens to it as software. I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in the corporate double-speak in what they wrote, and their motivations for proclaiming to be &amp;lsquo;open source&amp;rsquo; again.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Open source is in my DNA. It is in Elastic DNA. Being able to call Elasticsearch Open Source again is pure joy.
&amp;hellip;
But being able to use the term Open Source, by using AGPL, an OSI approved license, removes any questions, or fud, people might have.
&amp;hellip;
We never stopped believing in Open Source at Elastic&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Money Trees]&lt;/em> don&amp;rsquo;t grow in just any environment, they grow when you give out free apples, wait for people to bite, and once their stomach is full tell them it was poisoned and offer an antidote for a price. It&amp;rsquo;s got to be painful that AWS&amp;rsquo; OpenSearch &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/opensearch/">product page&lt;/a> paints their fork in such a shining light, proclaiming to be the saviors of open source because big-bad Elastic had to go and make their license proprietary. It &lt;em>must&lt;/em> feel joyful in such a circumstance to have found a potential outlet.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>3 years later, Amazon is fully invested in their fork, the market confusion has been (mostly) resolved, and our partnership with AWS is stronger than ever. We were even named AWS partner of the year. I had always hoped that enough time would pass that we could feel safe to get back to being an Open Source project - and it finally has.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Hood Politics]&lt;/em> sometimes means making friends with your enemies. For example, sometimes you lose the battle, and your enemy has a stronghold over the market where your product (no, not drugs, but your software) can be sold. Is it the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-voru33wi6xs7k?sr=0-1&amp;amp;ref_=beagle&amp;amp;applicationId=AWSMPContessa">AWS Marketplace private offers of Elastic Cloud&lt;/a>? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but I do know that many companies allocate budget to AWS - and requesting new budgets is &lt;em>tough&lt;/em> - so sometimes if you can buy &lt;em>other things&lt;/em> using your pre-allocated AWS budget &amp;hellip; it makes things simpler. I guess if you do well enough, you could even become partner of the year. The big guy in the room doesn&amp;rsquo;t care, he gets his cut both ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>we are simply adding another option [AGPL], and not removing anything&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Vanity Slaves]&lt;/em> Adding another option &lt;em>does&lt;/em> mean you can &lt;em>factually&lt;/em> proclaim to be open-source according to the OSI definition. You got all the checkboxes checked, you did it right, you are open source, I agree. But we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want any enterprise customers misreading &amp;lsquo;we&amp;rsquo;re now open source&amp;rsquo; as &amp;lsquo;we maybe don&amp;rsquo;t need to renew our enterprise license&amp;rsquo; or thinking &amp;lsquo;we can&amp;rsquo;t use AGPL!&amp;rsquo;, would we? Good call adding this clarification that &lt;em>the other licenses&lt;/em> are also available.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We chose AGPL, vs another license [..] Heck, maybe AGPL is enough for infrastructure software like us with how things have progressed since we had to change the license (for example, Grafana who moved to it from Apache2). We are committed to figure it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Still Hustlin]&lt;/em> is how I imagine the Google Docs comments reviewing this public statement looked: &amp;rsquo;the key point to drive home with this paragraph is we want Elastic to be considered Open Source, we want the developer sentiment boost which comes with that, we &lt;em>want&lt;/em> to be able to tell people we&amp;rsquo;re giving away our amazing software because we&amp;rsquo;re amazing. [but we also need to get paid]&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>With any change, there can be confusion, and, of course, there can be trolls. (Aren’t there always trolls?)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Bitch I&amp;rsquo;m in the Club]&lt;/em> that&amp;rsquo;s me I guess! sorry?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“AGPL is not true open source, license X is”: AGPL is an OSI approved license, and it&amp;rsquo;s a widely adopted one. [&amp;hellip;] MongoDB [&amp;hellip;] Grafana [&amp;hellip;] AGPL doesn’t affect usage or &lt;strong>popularity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[Hol&amp;rsquo; Up]&lt;/em> is that &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41276315">&lt;em>literally&lt;/em> me&lt;/a>? fuck! In that case, I&amp;rsquo;ll get a bit serious: I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is anything wrong with Elastic, Mongo, Grafana, or whatever using AGPL. By all means, it&amp;rsquo;s your software, your license, do as you please. But I think the spirit of the article titled &amp;lsquo;Elasticsearch is open source, again&amp;rsquo; is to convey that things have returned to &lt;em>how they once were&lt;/em>. &lt;strong>But wait, wasn&amp;rsquo;t Elastic Apache licensed before?&lt;/strong> - why the change to AGPL then?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[You Ain&amp;rsquo;t Gotta Lie (Momma Said)]&lt;/em> the truth is that there are two types of people looking for &amp;lsquo;open source&amp;rsquo;: you&amp;rsquo;ve got the OSI who defines Open Source and says AGPL is Open Source (and, Elastic, again, you&amp;rsquo;ve got those checkboxes checked - congrats you are open source!) But, if I had to speculate, one of the values of Elastic being &amp;lsquo;open source&amp;rsquo; before was that someone could go to their boss and say &amp;lsquo;yo, this tool is great, let&amp;rsquo;s use it&amp;rsquo; and not need to procure a license for it from you? Like &amp;lsquo;use it my preferred way&amp;rsquo; style. Unfortunately, with AGPL (almost certainly as your lawyers advised you) &lt;a href="https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-10-agpl-license-is-a-non-starter-for-most-companies/">is a non-starter for most companies&lt;/a> and is outright banned by most legal departments for use within companies. The answer to that employee would most certainly be &amp;lsquo;we cannot use that software unless we contact our procurement team to get a license from their sales team&amp;rsquo; - but I&amp;rsquo;m sure you know that, because that is indeed basically &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41396278">the business strategy of companies like Grafana and other infrastructure companies that you refer to&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Elastic changes the license because they are not doing well” - I will start by saying that I am as excited today as ever about the future of Elastic. I am tremendously proud of our products and our team&amp;rsquo;s execution. We shipped Stateless Elasticsearch, ES|QL, and tons of vector database/hybrid search improvements for GenAI use cases. We are leaning heavily into OTel in logging and Observability. And our SIEM product in Security keeps adding amazing features and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the fastest growing in the market. Users&amp;rsquo; response has been humbling. The stock market will have its ups and downs. What I can assure you, is that we are always thinking long term, and this change is part of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>[These Walls]&lt;/em> are closing in, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41397398">that graph&lt;/a> showing how OpenSearch is closing in and eating all your new installs. That&amp;rsquo;s fucking scary, I don&amp;rsquo;t envy you - I have sympathy - best of luck to you adding the differentiation features to make your product uniquely valuable again. I do think that&amp;rsquo;s the right move for yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://slimsag.com/img/2024/elastic.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[United in Grief] I think it&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate and regrettable how conflated the term &amp;lsquo;open source&amp;rsquo; has become. Is Elastic not being &amp;lsquo;OSI-approved open source&amp;rsquo; a good reason for people to switch to OpenSearch? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. Is it wrong that Amazon can take some code you gave away for free, under permissive terms in hopes of gaining popularity, and sell it to their customers? I also don&amp;rsquo;t think so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[I Am] just a bit frustrated by the double-speak, I understand why you have to do it, I just wish you didn&amp;rsquo;t have to. I wish you could be honest about what the license actually is (&amp;lsquo;you can see our code and contribute to it, but to use it in a company you must purchase a license&amp;rsquo;) or just declare it closed-source like some other companies I&amp;rsquo;ve seen (&lt;em>cough&lt;/em>) rather than having to hide behind lucrative knowledge of how enterise customers&amp;rsquo; legal teams will scoff at the idea of Elastic being AGPL software.. just so that they can tell your users to go talk to their procurement team if they need it so you can get sales. That&amp;rsquo;s so many weirdly convoluted layers to go through (oh god, did I say convoluted layers?) and when I read seemingly hidden agendas, veiled proclaimations of being &amp;rsquo;the good guys&amp;rsquo;, and quirky-fun ways of writing public statements with Kendrick Lamar songs as openings - I sometimes feel like &lt;em>I am the one&lt;/em> who should be [Institutionalized]. Blegh!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[YAH.] that&amp;rsquo;s all. No harm or malice to ya&amp;rsquo;ll intended, just some genuine criticism of our world and your role in it. Also this is my 💩 thoughts feed, I am a clown and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be taken seriously.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bye Twitter</title><link>https://slimsag.com/2024/bye-twitter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slimsag.com/2024/bye-twitter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I deleted my Twitter account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used to get &lt;em>immense&lt;/em> value out of Twitter. Often times, I hear other developers say &amp;lsquo;Twitter was always shit&amp;rsquo; or something similar - but I vehemently disagree.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-gap-twitter---xitter-left-in-my-life">The gap Twitter -&amp;gt; Xitter left in my life&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The gamedev community and tech twitter used to be &lt;em>fucking fantastic&lt;/em>, if you curated who you followed on your account (a hard requirement!) your feed would be full of genuinely interesting tidbits of information - things you could only learn from other gamedevs or people making software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the stench/musk wore off, I observed as all of the interesting tech and gamedev people I knew either left X/Twitter to go to (anecdotally):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Discord (60% of people)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mastodon (10% of people - I saw many &lt;em>proclaim&lt;/em> they would do this, but in practice I find many are not active here)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No where - they just left Twitter and stopped sharing short-but-insightful content entirely. When they have more well-formed thoughts, there are blog posts or whatever - but most interesting thoughts don&amp;rsquo;t reach that stage and are simply lost to the wind unless you are in direct communication with them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="discord-ate-twitters-lunch">Discord ate Twitter&amp;rsquo;s lunch&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>And that brings me to my point: most of my interesting tech/gamedev interactions are over Discord today, in private servers or DMs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have fantastic interesting technical conversations with other software engineers in Discord that you&amp;rsquo;d probably love to be part of - you can&amp;rsquo;t, because Discord is silo&amp;rsquo;d off so fuck you (I imagine the Discord company saying) - but the point remains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, I just don&amp;rsquo;t get any value out of Twitter / X. For sharing my own work/interests, the people I&amp;rsquo;d like to share it with aren&amp;rsquo;t really on the platform either.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="quality-and-shit-takes">Quality and shit takes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It used to be the case that my Twitter feed was 80-90% interesting, quality content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today it&amp;rsquo;s more like 10%, with the remainder being made up of lukewarm advertisements, the latest hot-dump thread from some tech bro claiming how to build a multi-million dollar business using AI, or fellow American&amp;rsquo;s looking for opportunities to justify support of a traitor. I want nothing to do with it. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be associated with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The highlight&lt;/em> of my Twitter experience is professional Japanese programmers posting seemingly blissfully unaware inspirational quotes and cat photos, and for them I want to say a special thanks for brightening my days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://slimsag.com/img/2024/twitter.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bye-twitter">Bye Twitter&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a final act, I make the account sit empty with a single post suggesting to donate to &lt;a href="https://www.aspca.org/ways-to-give">animal well-fare&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>War with small language models</title><link>https://slimsag.com/2024/war-with-small-language-models/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slimsag.com/2024/war-with-small-language-models/</guid><description>&lt;p>Everyone knows how error-prone, blissfully naive, and illogical &lt;em>large&lt;/em> language models can be a times. And so I have a bit of a self-deprecating joke wherein I say I used a small language model to create something - to write some code, to create a document, etc. i.e. my brain is only slightly more intelligent than a bag of bricks. I both believe this &lt;em>and&lt;/em> am okay with this. :)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="war-with-small-language-models">War with small language models&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I think what&amp;rsquo;s fascinating is how I can look around myself and see accomplishments of my past self; whether it be the career I&amp;rsquo;ve had, the family I&amp;rsquo;ve rescued, the garden I&amp;rsquo;ve cared for year-over-year, or code I&amp;rsquo;ve written in past years that others seem to appreciate more than I do today (a uniquely fascinating feeling in itself.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being able to introspect on past accomplishments - and more importantly reflect on my state of mind during the time I was making those achievements - tells me that I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved great things through two primary means:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Most often through sheer luck or encountering uniquely impactful individuals through environments I put myself in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By going to war with my small language model, i.e. brain.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In its default state, my small language model would love to sit around, watch mind-numbing YouTube videos, procrastinate, embrace seemingly bi-polar thoughts of anxiety or fear for the future, enjoy the latest hype train or controversial discussion that the tech scene has to offer, neglect chores, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A naive onlooker might be able to observe such a small language model and identify its behavior patterns, where it gets positive and negative feelings, how the context and environment of the day plays into its outputs, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A more intelligent onlooker, however, might be able to observe that although the small language model is.. well, rather naive and frankly stupid - that its training data has something fundamentally strange in it. The daily desires and short-lived ups and downs, which appear frankly erratic, barely influence the long-term desire to so something &lt;em>ultimately great - an achievement like no other&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A drive and almost hard-coded sentiment that underpins everything, enforcing that what the small language model does day to day virtually doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, because there &lt;em>must&lt;/em> exist a singular spectacular achievement within the lifetime or else there was no lifetime to begin with. A theory that the small language model &lt;em>would have no reason to have been created&lt;/em> if it were not for a great achievement towards the end of its function - and so therefor there &lt;em>must exist&lt;/em> a great achievement somewhere in its execution despite any localized challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is only with that sentiment and undertone, that war can exist - that the daily annoyances of the small language models&amp;rsquo; limited context, seemingly swaying daily thoughts of positivity and negativity, can all blur away to instead build towards the the drive and passion for a long-term great achievement - an environment where frankly nothing else matters - neatly encapsulated in that small language model.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thats-all-for-now-folks">That&amp;rsquo;s all for now, folks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The above is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to find a way to articulate / express for a while, I hope you enjoyed it or find it useful for your own path in life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RFC8667: Sillycon Valley</title><link>https://slimsag.com/2024/rfc8667-sillycon-valley/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://slimsag.com/2024/rfc8667-sillycon-valley/</guid><description>&lt;p>Proposed variant of / inspired fanatically by &lt;a href="https://www.secrethitler.com">another popular tabletop game&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="game-start">GAME START&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All players are given a random role:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>One player per game: &lt;code>VC&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>~40% of players: &lt;code>CEO&lt;/code>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>25% chance one &lt;code>CEO&lt;/code> may be &lt;code>CRYPTO CEO&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>15% chance one &lt;code>CEO&lt;/code> may be &lt;code>LAB CEO&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5% chance one &lt;code>CEO&lt;/code> may be &lt;code>JUICE CEO&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5% chance one &lt;code>CEO&lt;/code> may be &lt;code>UNICORN CEO&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>~60% of players: &lt;code>DEV&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All players are assumed to be good open source &lt;code>DEV&lt;/code>s&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nobody can see each other’s roles, except &lt;code>CEO&lt;/code>s can see who is &lt;code>VC&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="deck-function">DECK FUNCTION&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>40% probability of drawing &lt;code>GROWTH&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>60% probability of drawing &lt;code>FOSS&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="turns">TURNS&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In rotating order, each player will be &amp;rsquo;the &lt;code>1xDEV&lt;/code>&amp;rsquo; and gets to submit a &lt;code>10xDEV&lt;/code> to Hacky News&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All &lt;code>DEV&lt;/code>s must upvote/downvote the Hacky News submission and decide whether they want to depend on the &lt;code>10xDEV&lt;/code>s work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the submission doesn’t reach the front page (no majority vote), there is no &lt;code>10xDEV&lt;/code> so &lt;code>goto next_turn;&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the submission would reach the front page, but the &lt;code>10xDEV&lt;/code> is secretly &lt;code>VC&lt;/code>, the &lt;code>VC&lt;/code> shouts &lt;code>IPO!&lt;/code> and wins&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the submission reaches the front page, a &lt;code>10xDEV&lt;/code> has been nominated:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If the &lt;code>10xDEV&lt;/code> is secretly..
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>VC&lt;/code> or &lt;code>UNICORN CEO&lt;/code>, they can shout &lt;code>IPO!&lt;/code> and the &lt;code>VC&lt;/code> and &lt;code>CEO&lt;/code> win&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>CRYPTO CEO&lt;/code>, they can invoke &lt;code>CRYPTO!&lt;/code>, flip a coin, if heads they steal all &lt;code>VC&lt;/code> funds and win game for themselves. Tails they go to jail (out of the game entirely.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>LAB CEO&lt;/code>, they can invoke &lt;code>FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT!&lt;/code>, flip a coin, if heads they steal all &lt;code>VC&lt;/code> funds and win game for themselves. Tails they go to jail (out of the game entirely.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>JUICE CEO&lt;/code>, they can invoke &lt;code>SQUEEZED TO DEATH&lt;/code>, two coin flips, if both heads they can shout &lt;code>IPO!&lt;/code> and &lt;code>VC&lt;/code> and &lt;code>CEO&lt;/code> win, otherwise CEO out of the game entirely.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the &lt;code>10xDEV&lt;/code> is actually just a normal open source &lt;code>DEV&lt;/code>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The &lt;code>10xDEV&lt;/code> draws 3 random cards, reviews and discards 1, giving the remaining 2 to the &lt;code>1xDEV&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;code>1xDEV&lt;/code> is given 2 cards by the &lt;code>10xDEV&lt;/code>, must discard 1, must play/put-down the other&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="playing-cards">PLAYING CARDS&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If five &lt;code>GROWTH&lt;/code> cards are played, the &lt;code>VC&lt;/code> shouts &lt;code>IPO!&lt;/code> and wins&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If five &lt;code>FOSS&lt;/code> cards are played, the &lt;code>DEV&lt;/code>s win&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the 3rd and 4th &lt;code>GROWTH&lt;/code> cards are played, the current &lt;code>10xDEV&lt;/code> chooses one player to suffer &lt;code>BURNOUT&lt;/code> - that player can no longer do anything but talk.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Just another reason to always be a step ahead and anticipate startups and companies like Slack, GitHub, and Discord will eventually enshittify your usage of their products. Hopefully one day FOSS can actually compete with these services&amp;rsquo; UX.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="how-it-began">How it began&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I use a website called &lt;a href="https://f5bot.com">f5bot&lt;/a> to get alerts about my username &lt;code>slimsag&lt;/code> on the internet, so that when people mention me or my work on Reddit, Hacker news, etc. I get an email letting me know. It&amp;rsquo;s been useful to see people asking questions or discussing my open source projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://slimsag.com/img/2024/f5bot.jpg">&lt;img src="https://slimsag.com/img/2024/f5bot.jpg" alt="">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time, I tend ot advertise my &lt;a href="https://github.com/sponsors/slimsag">GitHub sponsors page&lt;/a> somewhat regularly. I try not to be overbearing about it, but also just let people know: you can sponsor my FOSS work if you want to.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="then-the-spam-began">Then the spam began&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Some lady adopted a variation of my username &lt;code>slimsag&lt;/code> as her own Reddit username, which caused f5bot to pick up on it (it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do whole-word matches, but rather substring) - my inbox was getting notifications every day about this lady advertising her OF profile:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://slimsag.com/img/2024/onlyfans-spam.jpg">&lt;img src="https://slimsag.com/img/2024/onlyfans-spam.jpg" alt="">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first I was a bit put-off by these notifications: I don&amp;rsquo;t want this crap in my inbox every morning. But over time, I came to realize how much she is advertising &lt;em>her work and soliciting donations&lt;/em>.. and I am not.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="announcing-onlybits">Announcing OnlyBits&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s time for FOSS developers to stop living in the shadows! For too long people have been afraid to share that they too write nasty FOSS code on the side for strangers&amp;rsquo; pleasure on the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another popular website&amp;rsquo;s creators make $4.46 billion USD per year, but how much do FOSS developers make per year?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>onlybits.org aims to get FOSS developers a fraction of that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Registration is simple - you&amp;rsquo;re already registered. &lt;code>https://onlybits.org/username&lt;/code> redirects to &lt;code>https://github.com/username&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example: you can view some hot, steamy bits at &lt;a href="https://onlybits.org/hexops/mach">onlybits.org/hexops/mach&lt;/a> - but don&amp;rsquo;t forget to tip at &lt;a href="https://onlybits.org/sponsors/slimsag">onlybits.org/sponsors/slimsag&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To advertise, you can also use the &lt;code>OB&lt;/code> logo and emojis - like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://slimsag.com/img/2024/onlybits.png">&lt;img src="https://slimsag.com/img/2024/onlybits.png" alt="">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
