## About me

<img src="/android-chrome-512x512.png" style="width: 200px; float: left; align-self: start !important; margin-left: 1rem;">

Hello, my name is **Emi Gutekanst** (pronounced like 'Emmy'); I was born with the name Stephen Gutekanst and assigned male at birth, I hid myself from all family/friends/coworkers for ~15 years of my life before coming out publicly as a trans girl following the 2024 US election results.

This page is a tl;dr for coworkers, professional peers, etc. who want to quickly understand how to respect me.

## What are your pronouns?

**They/them is fantastic.**

**If you slip up and call me 'he', 'him', 'dude', 'hey man', etc. or my old name, don't worry about it** - I've been hearing that my whole life and it doesn't personally phase me much. I understand that many people have never interacted with a trans person before, and I try to optimize for your personal comfort when interacting with you. This, of course, is just me.

I have a slight preference towards she/her in written text and they/them in verbal communication - but I understand that gets pretty confusing so really pick whichever is more comfortable for you! When in doubt, they/them is fantastic for me - so feel free to use that all the time.

## Where can I read more about your journey?

I wrote about it in [this blog post](https://slimsag.com/2024/coming-out/) (warning: contains mild profanity and political statements.)

## Where can I find you?

You can find me on [GitHub](https://onlybits.org/slimsag), [Hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=slimsag), or here.

I [write about game development](https://devlog.hexops.com/), am building [the Mach game engine](https://machengine.org/) in Zig, and when I'm not working with computers you can usually find me wrangling my [small cat shelter's worth of kittos](/categories/kittos) - or [gardening](/categories/gardening).

## What is this website?

This website's purpose is to replace my old usage of Twitter, so now you can have an RSS feed to my dumb ideas instead.

A lot of what I post here is stupid unprofessional jokes, pictures, etc. Sometimes I post programming related content, other times I post serious content.
