## About

This website's purpose is to replace my old usage of Twitter, so now you can have an RSS feed to my dumb ideas instead.

My name is _Stephen Gutekanst_ and yes I look a lot like the infamous Tom Anderson of Myspace.

You can find me on [Onlybits](https://onlybits.org/slimsag) (aka GitHub), [Hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=slimsag), or here.

I [write about game development](https://devlog.hexops.com/), am building [the Mach game engine](https://machengine.org/) in Zig, and when I'm not working with computers you can usually find me wrangling my [small cat shelter's worth of kittos](/categories/kittos) - or [gardening](/categories/gardening).
