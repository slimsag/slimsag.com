Slack today sent an announcement email indicating they will delete free workspace content older than a year, and that "Free workspaces will continue to have full access to the past 90 days of message history and file storage."

Just another reason to always be a step ahead and anticipate startups and companies like Slack, GitHub, and Discord will eventually enshittify your usage of their products. Hopefully one day FOSS can actually compete with these services' UX.

The full announcement email can be viewed below.
