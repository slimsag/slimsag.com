Today I deleted my Twitter account.

I used to get _immense_ value out of Twitter. Often times, I hear other developers say 'Twitter was always shit' or something similar - but I vehemently disagree.

## The gap Twitter -> Xitter left in my life

The gamedev community and tech twitter used to be _fucking fantastic_, if you curated who you followed on your account (a hard requirement!) your feed would be full of genuinely interesting tidbits of information - things you could only learn from other gamedevs or people making software.

After the stench/musk wore off, I observed as all of the interesting tech and gamedev people I knew either left X/Twitter to go to (anecdotally):

* Discord (60% of people)
* Mastodon (10% of people - I saw many _proclaim_ they would do this, but in practice I find many are not active here)
* No where - they just left Twitter and stopped sharing short-but-insightful content entirely. When they have more well-formed thoughts, there are blog posts or whatever - but most interesting thoughts don't reach that stage and are simply lost to the wind unless you are in direct communication with them.

## Discord ate Twitter's lunch

And that brings me to my point: most of my interesting tech/gamedev interactions are over Discord today, in private servers or DMs.

I have fantastic interesting technical conversations with other software engineers in Discord that you'd probably love to be part of - you can't, because Discord is silo'd off so fuck you (I imagine the Discord company saying) - but the point remains.

Today, I just don't get any value out of Twitter / X. For sharing my own work/interests, the people I'd like to share it with aren't really on the platform either.

## Quality and shit takes

It used to be the case that my Twitter feed was 80-90% interesting, quality content.

Today it's more like 10%, with the remainder being made up of lukewarm advertisements, the latest hot-dump thread from some tech bro claiming how to build a multi-million dollar business using AI, or fellow American's looking for opportunities to justify support of a traitor. I want nothing to do with it. I don't want to be associated with it.

_The highlight_ of my Twitter experience is professional Japanese programmers posting seemingly blissfully unaware inspirational quotes and cat photos, and for them I want to say a special thanks for brightening my days.

## Bye Twitter

As a final act, I make the account sit empty with a single post suggesting to donate to [animal well-fare](https://www.aspca.org/ways-to-give).
